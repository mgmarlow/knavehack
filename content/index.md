## Skill checks

Roll a d20 + ability score + modifiers (in +5/-5 increments from
advantages, disadvantages, and careers). If the total equals or
exceeds 11 + the task’s difficulty (usually 5), then you
succeed. Opposing ability scores and armor points can be used as a
task’s difficulty. If a creature doesn’t have ability scores,
substitute its level, half its level, or zero. GM’s call.

PCs know all common knowledge and career-related knowledge. All other
knowledge must be sought out.

## Combat

### Initiative

Make a `CHA` vs. `CHA` check between the sides’ leaders to determine
which side acts first. On a side’s turn, all of its creatures, in any
order, may move and take one other action, such as an attack, spell
casting, move, maneuver, etc.

### Attacks

Make a check using `STR` (for melee attacks) or `WIS` (for ranged
attacks) vs. defender’s armor class (11 + armor points). On a 21+, the
attacker may succeed at a free maneuver. On a natural 1, the weapon
breaks. Careers never add bonuses to attacks or maneuvers.

Ranged attacks cannot be made while in melee. If the target is in
melee, the attack takes a -5 penalty.

Melee attacks against unsuspecting foes always hit and deal direct
damage. Attacks against truly defenseless foes automatically kill
them.

#### Power attacks

After a successful attack roll but before rolling for damage, PCs can
decide to make a melee attack a power attack, which doubles the number
of damage dice rolled but breaks the weapon.

### Maneuvers

Maneuvers include disarming, pushing, stunning, blinding, breaking
gear, tripping, pickpocketing, climbing, restraining, or anything else
the GM agrees is plausible. They can only cause damage indirectly
(e.g., pushing an enemy off a ledge) and are resolved with an
appropriate ability check. They can be critical for bringing down
tough enemies.

### Damage

Hits deal damage equal to a roll of the weapon’s damage die. If an
enemy is weak to the type of damage being dealt, it deals direct
damage. If they are immune to that type, it deals no damage.

Damage is subtracted from HP. At 0 HP, each point of damage “wounds”
an item slot from highest to the lowest. Items in wounded slots are
dropped.

#### Direct damage

Direct damage bypasses HP and adds wounds directly. It
deals triple HP damage to creatures that don’t have slots, like
monsters.

#### Healing

HP fully heals each morning after two watches of sleep and a
meal the night before. While in a safe haven, this also heals one
wound.

#### Death

PCs die when all of their slots are filled with wounds. Monsters and
NPCs die at 0 HP.

## Spellcasting

A spellbook takes up an item slot and contains a single spell. They
cannot be created or copied by PCs and must be found while exploring
dungeons or stolen from other magic users.

### Casting spells

Casting a spell takes one action. Each spellbook can only be used once
per day, but PCs can use a number of spellbooks per day equal to their
`INT`.

### Spell saves

When a spell targets an unwilling creature with a level higher than
the spell, they may make a check vs. the spell’s level.  On a success,
the spell’s effect is halved. If they succeed by 10+, the effect is
nullified.

## Inventory

PCs have 10 + `CON` item slots to record their gear. Most items,
including groups of small items that could fit in one hand, take up
one slot. Two-handed items take two slots. 500 coins use a full slot.

### Equipment

All costs are in coins (c). 10c is the wage for a day of unskilled
labor.

**common items**: Found in any settlement.  Rope, torch, saw, arrow,
quiver, etc. (5c).

**uncommon items**: Found in towns or cities. Lantern, bear trap,
etc. (20c).

**rare items**: Found only in cities.  Sextant, hourglass, astrolabe,
etc. (100c+).

(100c). Quivers hold 20 arrows.

**armor pieces**: PCs can wear up to 7 pieces. Each uses one slot and
grants 1 AP (max of 7 AP or 18 Armor Class). Shield (100c), Helmet
(100c), Gambeson (100c), Mail shirt (200c), Breastplate (500c), Arm
plate (500c), Leg plate (500c).

## Dungeon delving

While dungeon delving, time is tracked in 10-minute segments called
turns. Most actions (moving, searching, fighting, resting, etc.) take
up one turn.

At the end of each turn, roll the Dungeon Hazard Die and apply the
result.

| d6           | hazard                                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. encounter | The party has a random encounter.                                                      |
| 2. fatigue   | Time advances 10 minutes as the party rests.                                           |
| 3. burn      | Torches tick down one use (out of three). When all three are ticked, torches burn out. |
| 4. shift     | The dungeon environment changes                                                        |
| 5. sign      | The players find a sign that a random encounter is nearby.                             |
| 6. free      | No effect.                                                                             |

If the encounter’s reaction to the party isn’t obvious, the GM may
roll 2d6 on the following table to determine their attitude. Note that
the PCs’ actions can cause this to change quickly.

| 2d6 | reaction |
|-----|----------|
|2| Kill the PCs|
|3| Injure or capture the PCs|
|4| Harass or rob the PCs|
|5| Insult, threaten, or command the PCs|
|6| Avoid the PCs|
|7| Ignore the PCs|
|8| Follow or observe the PCs|
|9| Greet or question the PCs|
|10| Share information with the PCs|
|11| Perform minor favors for the PCs|
|12| Ask to join the PC's party|

## Downtime activities

### Carousing

Carousing takes up a whole night and costs a PC d10×50c in villages,
d10×100c in towns, d10×200c in cities. It also grants the PC XP equal
to the amount spent. In the morning, succeed at a CON check or roll a
mishap.

|d20| mishap |
|--|-----------------------------------|
|1| You made a public fool of yourself.|
|2| Take d3 direct damage from a fight.|
|3| Pay d100c due to fines.|
|4| You are engaged to be married.|
|5| Lose d1000c from gambling.|
|6| Groupies follow you everywhere.|
|7| You’ve made an enemy.|
|8| You have an ugly, prominent tattoo.|
|9| Hangover: take -5 on all tests today.|
|10| You joined a local faction.|
|11| Robbed: Lose all remaining coin.|
|12| You wake up in prison.|
|13| The building is on fire!|
|14| You’re expected to complete a mission due to your boasts.|
|15| A duel is scheduled for the next dawn.|
|16| You signed a shady contract.|
|17| A stranger’s corpse is on the floor.|
|18| A faction hates you (p. 50).|
|19| All your belongings have been stolen.|
|20| You meet a new companion who wants to join your party.|

### Gambling

The player wagers some money (up to a house limit), then the GM rolls
a d6. The player then makes a choice; either bow out and forfeit half
of their wager or try to roll higher on a d6 than the GM’s roll. If
they roll and succeed, they double their money. If they fail, they
lose their entire wager.

### Career training

To gain a new career, a PC must find an expert in the field they wish
to study and spend the required time and money. Gaining a career gives
PCs career-related knowledge, the ability to attempt related tasks and
a +5 on related non-combat checks.

**common**: Requires 1 month and 1000c (carpenter, hunter, fisherman,
sailor, dyer, gardener, blacksmith, etc.).

**uncommon careers**: Requires 3 months and 5000c to attempt related tasks
and an additional 3 months and 5000c to gain a +5 to related
non-combat checks (burglar, acrobat, locksmith, grave robber,
herbalist, tattooist, prospector, etc.).

**rare careers**: Requires 1 year and 30,000c to attempt related tasks and
an additional year and 30,000c to gain a +5 to related non-combat
checks (alchemist, lawyer, assassin, sculptor, folklorist, etc.).

### Alchemy

Potions allow the drinker to produce a single significant magical
effect. If the effect is ongoing (like invisibility), it lasts for one
10-minute turn. Weak ongoing effects (like beast speech), may last for
an hour or even a day if they are very weak. A drop of a potion gives
a clue as to its effects. If the players find or buy a potion you can
either use one of the examples to the right or generate something
using the magic tables.

Brewing a potion requires a fire, a cauldron, ingredients, and four
hours (one watch) of time. The player describes the effect and
duration of the potion they are trying to make, along with the
ingredients to be used (usually monster parts, but in theory any rare
substances with the right properties could be used). If the GM
approves the effect, the PC makes an INT check. The PC adds +5 to the
check if they spend an additional watch brewing. On a success, the
potion is created. The parts are lost no matter the outcome. If the PC
succeeds at the check by 10 or more, they have created a recipe for
that potion and no longer need to make a brewing check to make it when
using those exact ingredients.

Magical plants can be used for potions, but they usually grow in
dangerous or lost locations. Most potions are made from the organs of
monsters that give them their special abilities, such as a dragon's
lung (fire breathing) or a dragon's scales (fireproofing). Harvesting
a monster part requires one 10-minute turn and the proper
tools. Harvested body parts or plants take up at least one slot, due
to the packaging and fluids they must be preserved in.

## Refereeing

### Hazards

**fire**: 1d6 direct damage per round. On fire: 2d6 direct damage per
round. Immersed in lava: instant death.

**drowning**: PCs can hold their breath for 30 seconds + 30 seconds for
each point of CON. After this, they pass out and must pass a CON check
every round or die.

**freezing**: 1 direct damage per 10-minute turn unless the PC passes
a CON check.

**lightning**: 3d6 direct damage. falling: 1d6 direct damage per 10’
fallen. If at least three of the dice roll a 6, the PC is instantly
killed.

**thirst**: Each day without drinking water applies a -5 penalty to
all checks. After three days, pass a CON check every day or
die. Assume that the PCs are finding water to drink as they travel,
unless they are in a very arid environment.

**sleep deprivation**: For each day without sleep, apply -5 to all
checks. After two days, make a WIS check every watch or pass out for
three watches.

**intoxication**: Make a CON check every hour that a PC drinks
alcohol. If they fail, they become drunk and take -5 to all checks
until the next day. If a creature fails the CON check two hours in a
row, they pass out for two watches (8 hours).

### Monster morale

When NPCs reach a breaking point during a battle, they must test their
morale by rolling equal to or under their morale rating on 2d6. If
they roll over it, they rout or surrender. They may reroll a failed
test once per battle if their leader passes a CHA check. Breaking
points include after losing half their HP (if alone), after their
first casualty, after half of their forces are lost, after their
leader is killed, and after they are attacked by something they fear.
