## Create a character

### 1. Record ability scores

Distribute 3 points between your PC’s ability scores. More than 1
point can be placed in the same score. Or, let fate decide by rolling
3d6, with each die adding 1 to the ability score matching the number
it rolled.

_Example: rolling 3-5-5 means `CON` (the 3rd ability) is 1 and WIS
(the 5th ability) is 2. All other abilities have a score of 0._

### 2. Record secondary stats

PCs start at level 1 with 0 XP. They have 10 + `CON` item slots and
start with d6 maximum Hit Points (HP).

### 3. Pick two careers

Roll or pick two careers. You gain those careers’ items, as well as
any of the following that you can carry: 3d6×10 coins, three rations,
a 50’ rope, 2 torches, any armor pieces or weapons and a quiver of 20
arrows. If the PC has any points in `INT`, they may receive a random
spell book for each point.

career 1:

{% tableroll "careers" %}

career 2:

{% tableroll "careers" %}

### 4. Record armor

PCs have Armor Points `AP` equal to their number of armor pieces and
an Armor Class `AC` equal to `AP` + 11.

### 5. Finishing touches

Name and describe your character.
