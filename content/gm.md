## GM notes

### Monster morale

When NPCs reach a breaking point during a battle, they must test their
morale by rolling equal to or under their morale rating on 2d6. If
they roll over it, they rout or surrender. They may reroll a failed
test once per battle if their leader passes a CHA check. Breaking
points include after losing half their HP (if alone), after their
first casualty, after half of their forces are lost, after their
leader is killed, and after they are attacked by something they fear.

### Converting modules

#### Economy

If you are using a pre-made dungeon from another RPG that uses copper,
silver, electrum, gold, and platinum coins, convert the total to gold
coins and gain that much XP.
