# For GMs

## Stocking dungeons

Use this table to fill each room of a dungeon:

| d100  | contents              |
|-------|-----------------------|
| 01-16 | empty                 |
| 17-20 | unguarded treasure    |
| 21-60 | monster               |
| 61-84 | monster with treasure |
| 85-88 | special               |
| 89-96 | trap                  |
| 97-00 | trap with treasure    |

## Monster stat breakdown

- AC: target number necessary to hit the monster.
- HD: # of hit dice. Monsters always roll d8s for hit points, unless
  otherwise noted. HD doubles as level for the ability score added for
  checks.
- ATK: number/type of attacks in one round. Monsters armed with
  weapons typically deal d6 damage.
- MOV: slow/normal/fast/flying. A normal MOV (default) allows monsters
  to move Nearby just like PCs.
- MRL: how likely the monster is to flee/surrender during combat.
- NA: how many monsters are encountered together. X/Y where X is the
  number for dungeons, Y is the number for wilderness. If only X, both
  are the same.
- Anything else: special notes for abilities and tactics.

e.g.

```
bandit: AC 13, HD 1, ATK d6, MRL 8, NA: d8/3d10. Likes to ambush.
```

### Morale

When NPCs reach a breaking point during a battle, they must test their
morale by rolling equal to or under their morale rating on 2d6. If
they roll over it, they rout or surrender. They may reroll a failed
test once per battle if their leader passes a CHA check. Breaking
points include after losing half their HP (if alone), after their
first casualty, after half of their forces are lost, after their
leader is killed, and after they are attacked by something they fear.

## Converting modules

### Economy

If you are using a pre-made dungeon from another RPG that uses copper,
silver, electrum, gold, and platinum coins, convert the total to gold
coins and gain that much XP.
