# knavehack

A mashup of [Knave: Second
Edition](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave-second-edition) and [The
Black Hack](https://the-black-hack.jehaisleprintemps.net/english/).
Knavehack is a simple, classless system that runs in the [OSR
tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance). Your
equipment defines your role, your coins define your XP, and your
improvisation defines your success.
